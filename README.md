### Introduction

---

Nxtspace Mobile is a React Native-based 3D scene-building mobile application for the architecture industry.

Whether or not you have any modeling experience, you can get started easily. With Nxtspace Mobile you can quickly fulfill your 3D architectural scene-building needs and effortlessly create your own Demo.

Nxtspace Mobile runs on Android, iOS and other mobile platforms, leveraging React Native for cross-platform capability and Gluestack UI for a consistent mobile interaction experience.

### Features / Roadmap

Tips: ⚪ Planning 🟡 In progress 🟢 Done

- 🟢 Editor core
  - 🟢 2D floor plan
    - 🟢 Wall drawing (straight / arc wall one-click conversion, orthogonal / angled drawing, inner / outer / middle placement lines, cancellable mid-drawing)
    - 🟢 Door and window openings (auto-cut when inserted into walls, single-leaf / double-leaf / doorway / multiple styles)
    - 🟢 Door & window cross-wall movement (drag onto an adjacent wall to place it directly, chained rulers give real-time landing-distance feedback, ghost preview follows the cursor while drawing)
    - 🟢 Region drawing (closed rooms auto-calculate area, polygon regions supported)
    - 🟢 Furniture placement (drag models into the scene + real-time snapping & alignment + landing-point preview)
    - 🟢 Vertex editing (drag wall endpoints / corners to fine-tune, walls auto-recalculate)
    - 🟢 Dimension annotations (wall length / angle shown in real time, independent show/hide toggle, ruler length during drawing can be typed to commit)
    - 🟢 Clear-distance ruler (while dragging, show the four-direction nearest clear distance to walls / adjacent objects in real time)
    - 🟢 Reference lines (horizontal / vertical / circular guides, customizable color, layer-managed, circles follow canvas zoom & pan)
    - 🟢 Reference images (use CAD / floor plans / any image as a tracing underlay, with zoom / pan / opacity controls)
    - 🟢 Grid and rulers (grid toggle + snapping, horizontal & vertical rulers sync with zoom / pan)
    - 🟢 Right-click menu (context actions: copy / paste / delete / group / lock / properties / rename)
    - 🟢 Interactive minimap thumbnail (drag the focus frame to pan the main scene, scroll-wheel zoom anchored on the cursor)

  - 🟢 3D visualization
    - 🟢 One-click 2D / 3D view switching
    - 🟢 Orthographic / perspective projection toggle
    - 🟢 Quick view switching (front / side / top / bottom / left / right / isometric)
    - 🟢 View-cube helper (bottom-right cube, click a face / edge / corner to switch the view)
    - 🟢 Dollhouse mode (auto back-face culling of walls based on camera position, see interior when looking from above)
    - 🟢 Walk mode
      - 🟢 First-person (mouse lock + WASD movement / Shift to run / Space to jump, with physics collision blocking)
      - 🟢 Third-person (orbit camera around the target)
    - 🟢 Rendering styles
      - 🟢 Material (PBR materials & textures + lighting)
      - 🟢 Material & outline (materials with outline overlay)
      - 🟢 Outline (pure outline mode)
    - 🟢 Three render quality levels (high / balanced / performance, switched by device capability)
    - 🟢 Unified 2D/3D visual feedback (hover outline, selection bounding box, selection tinting, snapping markers always on top)
    - 🟢 Sky and ground (solid color / texture, 50+ texture options)
    - 🟢 Right-side 3D real-time preview
    - 🟢 3D scene thumbnail

  - 🟢 Read-only preview
    - 🟢 3D viewing (no editing operations)
    - 🟢 Search & locate, view switching, stylized rendering

- 🟢 Component library & asset library
  - 🟢 Structural components
    - 🟢 Walls (thickness / height / material defaults)
    - 🟢 Door openings (single-leaf / double-leaf / no door)
    - 🟢 Windows (size / sill height / style adjustable)
    - 🟢 Regions (parameterized room defaults)

  - 🟢 Indoor model library
    - 🟢 Category browsing (living room / bedroom / kitchen / bathroom / office / other; categories with no search results are auto-hidden)
    - 🟢 Search filtering (quickly find components by name)
    - 🟢 Custom model import (upload GLB / ZIP packages, set size, category, and name; the single-item dialog supports opening-type selection and zip-template download)
    - 🟢 Batch import (download template ZIP, batch-upload models + covers, generate a result report)

- 🟢 Materials & textures
  - 🟢 Asset-library materials tab (built on the SweetHome3D material library, aggregated by category, real-world-scale tiling, full bilingual names)
  - 🟢 Material picker (thumbnail preview + hover zoom + search + category grouping)
  - 🟢 Drag-to-tile (drag a material onto region faces and wall A/B faces; works for both textures and solid colors)
  - 🟢 Flood-fill tiling (hold a modifier key to propagate the material across physically adjacent faces; a continuous wall fills in one pass as a single undo entry)
  - 🟢 Material brush (eyedropper-pick a region-face / wall material and paint it directly onto targets; works in both 2D and 3D; Esc exits and restores the pre-entry view)

- 🟢 Editing & operations
  - 🟢 Basic operations
    - 🟢 Pointer tool (switch back to selection state, exit drawing mode)

    - 🟢 Segment snapping (align to full segment length)
    - 🟢 Grid snapping (align to integer steps; 3D grid line detail adapts with zoom)
    - 🟢 Reference-line snapping (magnet to guides)
    - 🟢 Constant snap radius (trigger radius converted from screen pixels, so sensitivity stays consistent at any zoom)
